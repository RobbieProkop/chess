# Chess Game and Engine built with JavaScript

In this project, I intend on making a chess web app using JavaScript, and potentially expanding this project ot becoming a mobile app using React Native.

The goal is to learn as much as I can about how chess engines work, and learn some new technologies in the process. I plan on starting out with JavaScript for both the front and the backend, but I may change the backend engine to another language in order to optimize performance and learn a new language in the process.

I'm starting out by following along a video series by [Bluefever Software](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGAfaepBco4&list=PLZ1QII7yudbc-Ky058TEaOstZHVbT-2hg) on youtube, as well as use a 2001 resource from [Bruce Moreland](https://web.archive.org/web/20070607151549/http://www.brucemo.com/compchess/programming/time.htm).
